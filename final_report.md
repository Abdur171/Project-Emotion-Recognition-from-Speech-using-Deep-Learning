EMOTION RECOGNITION PROJECT - FINAL REPORT
===========================================

DATASET
--------
- RAVDESS dataset, 4 emotions: neutral, happy, sad, angry
- 672 total samples (192 happy, 192 sad, 192 angry, 96 neutral)
- Speaker-independent split: 448 train, 112 validation, 112 test
- 24 actors (16 train, 4 validation, 4 test)

MODELS COMPARED
---------------

1. CNN Baseline (Spectrogram-based)
   - Architecture: 3 conv layers + 2 fully connected
   - Parameters: 1,535,556 (all trainable)
   - Input: Log-mel spectrograms (64 mel bands)
   - Training: 50 epochs, 3 random seeds

2. Pretrained Model (Transfer Learning)
   - Base: wav2vec2-base (torchaudio)
   - Parameters: 94,601,220 total, 230,276(2x for the enhanced model) trainable
   - Input: Raw audio waveforms
   - Training: 25 epochs, classifier only (encoder frozen)

RESULTS
-------

Overall Performance:
- CNN Baseline:      Accuracy = 0.6101 +- 0.0360, 
                     Macro F1 = 0.5900 +- 0.0475
- Pretrained Model:  Accuracy = 0.6339, 
                     Macro F1 = 0.5436

Key Findings:
1. The pretrained model achieved higher overall accuracy (+6% absolute)
2. The CNN model showed more balanced performance across classes
3. Both models struggled with neutral emotion recognition
4. The pretrained model excelled at recognizing angry emotion (F1=0.79)
5. Transfer learning required significantly fewer trainable parameters

ERROR ANALYSIS
--------------

CNN Model:
- Most balanced performance across emotions
- Neutral class remains challenging (F1=0.42)
- Consistent performance across random seeds

Pretrained Model:
- Excellent for angry emotion recognition
- Very poor performance on neutral class (F1=0.11)
- Potential reasons: 
  * Neutral speech patterns may be too similar to the base model's training data
  * Class imbalance (fewer neutral samples)
  * May be conflating neutral with other emotions

CONCLUSIONS
-----------

1. Both models provide reasonable baselines for emotion recognition
2. The pretrained model shows promise but needs better handling of neutral class
3. The CNN model offers more consistent and balanced performance
4. Transfer learning can provide good performance with minimal training

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
-------------------------------

1. Address class imbalance for neutral emotion
2. Experiment with fine-tuning parts of the pretrained encoder
3. Add data augmentation specifically for emotional speech
4. Try ensemble approaches combining both models
5. Explore attention mechanisms for better temporal modeling
6. Just retrain the pretrained model with class weights
   python train_pretrained_final.py
   But modify the loss function to:
   criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss(weight=torch.tensor([2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]))
